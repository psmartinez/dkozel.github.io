Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Derek. I'm an electrical engineer with a particular passion for embedded sytems, RF communications, and aerospace applications. I am an Amateur Radio operator currently focusing on the design and construction of systems for microwave bands. Prior to my current work I've worked on Software Defined cellular basestation radios and developed low power sensor nodes. My masters work and courses involved evolutionary algorithms and low power computer architecture and software design.

When not playing with something with bits or volts I enjoy cycling, diving, and cooking.

This site centers on my engineering interests but will inevitably include occasional posts and references to anything I feel passionate about. The wiki serves as an informal and incomplete information repository and everything should be taken with an unhealthy heap of salt. That said, I hope all the material avaliable proves some use and you enjoy my site.

### Colophon

The site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (via [Octopress 2](http://octopress.org/)) and uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and [Pygments](http://pygments.org/). The theme is [Readify](https://github.com/vladigleba/readify). I compose the posts using Vim with a variety of [customizations](https://github.com/dkozel/vimfiles). All files for the site and wiki are managed using Git.

The wiki is powered by [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) and the repository viewer is [GitList](http://gitlist.org/). Both are hosted by [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/) on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) VPS running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The domain and DNS are managed by [NearlyFreeSpeech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/).
