<p>Unfortunately the weight of the dish and angle of the mount means that there was a gap between the final panels.

<p>Using a set of C Clamps we were able to pull the edges nearly together, but the bolt holes were  offset by just over a centimeter.
<img src="http://dkozel.github.io/media/big_dish_gap_cclamps.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The offset is probably resolvable just with some long bolts and a bit of coersion. Worse is that the center of the dish was pulled over an inch out of position. Given that the dish weighs in excess of 400 pounds without the metal bracing it would take a small crane or similar to even try pulling it into order. The lack of a crane is exactly why we assembled it piece by piece.

    <updated>2015-08-05T06:19:21-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dkozel.github.io/blog/basic-quadcopter-build</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long term desire of mine has been to build a multicopter. Three years ago I tried flying a model powered glider and it went like a stone in a pool. In hindsight a glider is very good at catching any breeze so was a poor choice for a beginner as it was pushed far away before I could get a grip on controlling it. a few trees and almost a window later it was put in a closet then given to Goodwill. A multicopter has a much shorter flight time, but far lower wind load and can be held stationary with little effort even without fancy additions like GPS.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>As the previous foray had not gone far I did not want to overinvest in the project so chose to do a small quadcopter with a standard frame and popular components. While I still spent far too long selecting components the core philosophy was, if lots of other people are using it there will be lots of resources to help configure and tune the part and total system. This worked wonderfully.</p>

<p>Picking the frame, an EMAX 250, narrowed the selection of other components considerably. The maximum propeller size was 6 inches, but that assumes very good wiring and harnessing of the battery, flight controller, and radio so I went with 5 inch ones. This also provides slightly more crash resiliance as the frame protects a higher proportion of the blades without getting too close while spinning. The motor and ESC controller selections stuck to to the popular and simple route, EMAX 1806 2280KV motors with EMAX 20A ESCs. These ESCs are oversized, both in current capacity and physical dimensions, for the frame but will be useful for future larger frames and were minimally more expensive than the 12A ones. The EMAX ESCs run a slightly modified fork of the SimonK firmware. My flight controller will soon have the functionality to alter ESC parameters</p>

<p>The flight controller is a Naze32 Acro. It runs the CleanFlight firmware, which is a fork of the BaseFlight firmware which is a port of the MultiWii firmware! The open nature of both the hardware and variety of firmwares gives plentiful options to modify and add functionality as desired. The CleanFlight configurator provides a powerful interface for configuring the control loops and flight behavior. The receiver control inputs can have a mapping applied to give logarithmic responses to linear input changes for instance, useful for having both fine control for manouvers and coarse control for avoiding obstacles or stunts. The PID loop algorithm and parameters can be adjusted in realtime even via a serial link. I did not buy the bluetooth bridge for that though.</p>

<p>The transceiver I chose is the Taranis X9D Plus with an X4R receiver. The Taranis runs OpenTX firmware which also has a companion GUI for configuring profiles, both are open source and under active development. For now the configuration is simple, but does have one handy feature. I found that having 100% responsiveness was difficult to handle so Switch A now applies a 50%, 66% or 100% multiplier to all control outputs depending on its state.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-05T06:18:48-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dkozel.github.io/blog/pelco-pan-tilt-head</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some time I’ve been working on a setup for receiving from, and eventually transmitting to, satellites and other moving aerial targets such as high altitude balloons. The initial design was based off of the work done by the <a href="https://satnogs.org/">SatNOGS</a> team, but ran into reliability issues when 3D printing a revised version of the helical antenna joints. Additionally the SatNOGS design is being iterated at the moment and their rotator design wasn’t complete. In searching for alternative elevation azimuth rotator designs a few options came up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a SatNOGS style rotator from servos</li>
  <li>Join two single axis satellite dish rotators</li>
  <li>Use a manual pan tilt head such as the Quickset Herculese line</li>
  <li>Buy a commercial two axis antenna rotator
<!-- more --></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these was a viable design with examples of working systems easy to find online. However given limited time and money non was a good match for me. Then another option came up, using a pan tilt head for CCTV cameras! These are built for a high duty cycle, heavy loads, remote operation, and long life spans. The trade off is that they are generally expensive, have odd power requirements, and often quite heavy. The control systems also come in a variety of physical styles and protocols. The nicest ones have RS 485 interfaces with well documented protocols.</p>

<p>What I ended up with is a Pelco PT280-24P head with a MPT24DT controller which doubles as a power supply. The head’s motors run directly off of 24VAC lines coming from the controller which has a single interface, a joystick. The controller unfortunately runs off of 120VAC so I’m looking into buying a 12VDC to 24VAC boost inverter so I can run it either from an easily sourced wall brick or from batteries/solar while portable. The joystick interface should be simple to integrate with using some analog outputs. However there is no positioning feedback from the head so that’s another feature which will need to be added. I’m not sure if using one of the inexpensive accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer boards is overkill so will probably start with simple potentiometer based feedback. The PT280-24P/PP model includes this feedback as well as circuitry to move the camera to specific set points. Documentation online indicates that the internal hardware is missing so a simple breakout modification is not possible. Another option is to add a camera with a computer vision based feedback, but this is almost certainly adding complication for the sake of being fancy.</p>

<p>The head and controller are in the mail now so I’ll start work on the system after returning from an upcoming conference.</p>

    <updated>2014-12-26T09:21:52-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://dkozel.github.io/blog/using-an-openpgp-card</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought an <a href="http://g10code.com/p-card.html">OpenPGP card</a> earlier this year and created a new GPG key (<a href="http://www.derekkozel.com/2642D337.asc">2642D337</a>) during IETF 89. I’ve been using that key to sign git commits, ssh, and sign/encrypt significant emails and files. However I locked the card on purpose while experimenting with it and then encountered problems unlocking and reloading it. Since then the card has been taking up space in my wallet. Yesterday I was lounging and decided to look at my GPG setup and get the card working.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Werner Koch helpfully supplied <a href="http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2009-September/037413.html" title="Resetting an OpenGPG Card">simple instructions</a> on resetting an OpenGPG 2.0 card on the GnuPG mailing list. The idea is quite simple, completely lock the card by trying incorrect admin and user PINs then terminate and reactivate the card. Unfortunately this is done using gpg-connect-agent which was producing error messages for me.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line">gpg-connect-agent: can&#39;t connect to the agent: IPC connect call failed</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Daniel at Ozone Solutions has a good post about the basic setup of using the OpenGPG card with Ubuntu and has an update for Ubuntu 14.04 pointing out that there’s an issue with gpg-agent not running correctly. The solution is to ensure that one and only one gpg-agent daemon is running at a time and that the environment is correctly initialized. I added the following block to my .bash_local file which is sourced from <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>.bash_local</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">. /tmp/gpg-agent.env
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This fixed the gpg-connect-agent IPC error allowing me to successfully run the reset commands on the card.</p>

<p>You should see 69 83 and 90 00 replies amongst the response indicating that the PIN tries have been exhausted and the card has been terminated and reactivated. It took several tries for me to get those responses. You can check the status of the card at any point.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line">PIN retry counter : <span class="m">3</span> <span class="m">3</span> 3
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The first counter is the user pin, then reset code, then the admin pin. The script should reduce user and admin to zero, then reset the card returning all three to 3. You can enter the commands by hand as necessary. I also had to run the last two commands by hand. Your mileage may vary. The default pins are 123456 for the user and 12345678 for the admin.</p>

<p>Your name, url of your public key, preferred language, login name, and whether to require a fresh pin entry for every signature can be set using <code>gpg2 --card-edit</code>. The various guides referenced here have detailed descriptions of configuring the card and keys so I won’t repeat it. However here’s a <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch03s03.html" title="GPG Card Administration">command reference</a> for the impatient.</p>

<p>At this point you can load your (sub)key(s) onto the card. <a href="https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices" title="PGP best practices">Riseup</a> has a list of tests you should run on your key if you have already generated one and good instructions if you haven’t. My key fails several of the tests due to issues such as subkeys being self-signed using SHA1, however I don’t see this as a critical enough issue for me to regenerate the keys at this point as none of my uses require the highest degree of verification. But it’s always good to know where the weaknesses in your security plan are. At the end is a reference <code>gpg.conf</code> file with the recommended settings. Ana Guerrero has posted a succinct and, in my non-expert view, complete <a href="http://ekaia.org/blog/2009/05/10/creating-new-gpgkey/" title="Key generation guide">guide</a> for creating a secure modern key.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to backup your private key somewhere safe. Printed on paper is a good method, but a LUKS encrypted volume is a much more convenient, but still quite secure, method of digitally backing it up. Chris Boots has posted a <a href="http://www.bootc.net/archives/2013/06/07/generating-a-new-gnupg-key/" title="Secure digital backups">nice guide</a> for both generating keys, backing them up, and loading them onto a smartcard. He does miss changing the hashing algorithms though.</p>

<p>If you already have your key generated and wish to use the LUKS backup method, just follow Chris’ guide until you have created the backup volume then instead of generating a new key import your existing one. Then close the volume as Chris describes.</p>

<p>The final step that I took was to add a photo to my key. The recommended size is 240x288 and as the image is distributed with the public key it is useful to minimize the filesize. I used Shotwell to crop the image with the above aspect ratio, convert to resize it, and trimage to compress it. The final size was 14KB which under doubles the size of the total key as I have four 4KB keys, even on a mobile connection this shouldn’t be any problem.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-08T18:21:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dkozel.github.io/blog/latex-in-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many of the topics I work with involve math left, right, and center. Being able to use <script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script> is a big feature for me so here’s the solution I’ve come up with so far. Credit certainly goes to  <a href="http://drz.ac/2013/01/03/blogging-with-math/">Dr Zac</a> and <a href="http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/03/10/writing-math-equations-on-octopress/">Felix</a> for their work getting Latex playing nice. I believe that Zac’s is the more correct solution given its use of the custom header file rather than modifying the default layout. However Felix has the fix for a bug in MathJax which otherwise turns the entire page white when viewing an equation’s source.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The first step is to change the Markdown processor to be kramdown (or pandoc if you prefer, see Dr Zac’s page) as it supports Latex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In <code>Gemfile</code> replace <code>rdiscount</code> with <code>kramdown</code> and remove the version requirement.</li>
  <li>In <code>_config.yml</code> replace <code>rdiscount</code> with <code>kramdown</code> as the markdown parser</li>
  <li>Run <code>bundle install</code> to install Kramdown if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now add the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> script to each page’s header</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>source/_includes/custom/head.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Finally fix the MathJax right click bug if necessary. I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/vladigleba/readify">readify</a> theme which doesn’t trigger the bug, however the default theme does.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>sass/base/_theme.scss</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most engineers, and probably most people in general, will be familiar with how projects and tasks accumulate. Finishing university and moving three times in two months has pushed my todo list past the end of the page. I sat down today and wrote down everything I could think of that I wished, or was obliged, to accomplish in the next month and have to admit that some (many) of the project ideas that float through my head simply aren’t going to get done.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I already did a cull of the project list in May when I was packing to move out of my apartment in Mountain View. I’m happy to say that my workbench did see a lot of use over the last year and that many projects did get finished. However almost an equal number stalled out for lack of a part, a gap in my knowledge which turned into a rabbit hole spawning new projects, or simply because there are only so many hours in a day. So nearly all of the physical items attached to zombie projects were given away or recycled. Now the time has come to reap the list again and start fresh (mostly).</p>

<p>I’m declaring Project Bankruptcy, inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy">Email Bankruptcy</a>. Unless I have made an explicit commitment to complete a task or have a continuing duty to support a system, its all being dropped. Some of the dropped projects will bounce right back onto my list because of their immediate relevance (such as figuring out the dynamic dns settings of our new router) and that’s fine. But so many of these projects and tasks are no longer (or never were) important and are just mental cruft.</p>

<p>One of the few visible changes as a result of this will be the clearing out of past, partially completed posts on this blog and the removal of a number of public repositories that aren’t relevant to anyone. Sorry if anyone misses something.</p>
